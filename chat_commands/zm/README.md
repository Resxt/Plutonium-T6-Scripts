- Set round

- Restart current round

| Name | Description | Arguments expected | Example | Permission level |

| setround | Kills all zombies and changes the round to the specified round | (1) the desired round number | `!setround 10` | 4 |

It's recommend to only run these commands after at least one zombie has fully spawned (got out of the ground and starts walking).  
Your score and kills don't increase when running these commands even if you're technically the one who kills the zombies.
